# Nuvi-challenge

Simple UI to display JSON data as part of my application.

I decided on using [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com/) to build the UI as it would give me an opportunity to learn Ember. To take the concept further, I would move the data into an Ember data model and add pagination so a limited number of results would be shown at a time.
